puzzle, a problem that may take many forms, including games and toys, and is solved through knowledge, ingenuity, or other skills. The solver of a puzzle must arrive at the correct answer, or answers, by thinking or putting pieces together in a logical way. There are different genres of puzzles, from word puzzles such as crosswords and number puzzles to mechanical puzzles such as the Rubik’s Cube. Puzzles often serve as a method of keeping one’s mind active and as a pastime, as seen by their prevalence in daily newspapers and online, but they are also at the centre of fiercely contested global competitions such as the World Puzzle Championship.
